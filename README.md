This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Python: a `TypeError` that occurs when a list containing both numbers and strings is passed to a function calculating the average. The `calculate_average` function successfully handles empty lists, but it does not perform a check for non-numeric values. This leads to an error when trying to calculate the sum of the mixed list. The solution handles the type error by checking for non-numeric inputs and appropriately handling them.
